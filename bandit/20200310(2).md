# Level 13 -> Level 14
The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.**
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
**Note: localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.
